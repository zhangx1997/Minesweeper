Challenges Faced While Making This App: It is challenging to program the game logics. Ensuring that the Minesweeper grid could dynamically adjust to different screen sizes and handle edge cases (like clicking on a mine or revealing adjacent squares) without breaking the flow of the game was tricky. Additionally, setting up routing and ensuring that each part of the app (such as the rules and home screens) worked seamlessly with the game screen added another layer of complexity.

Additional Features/Functional or Design Changes with More Time: I would implement a timer feature to track how long the player takes to complete the game and a leaderboard to allow players to compare their scores. On the design side, I would improve the responsiveness of the app, making sure it works smoothly across mobile and tablet devices, as well as adding animations for button clicks and game interactions for a more polished user experience.

Assumptions Made While Working on This Assignment: During the development, I assumed that the user would have a basic understanding of how Minesweeper works, so I didnâ€™t spend too much time on explaining the rules within the app. I also assumed the app would be played in a desktop or laptop environment, so some responsiveness adjustments could have been better optimized for mobile screens.

Time Taken to Complete This Assignment: This assignment took approximately 40 hours to complete. The majority of the time was spent working on the core game logic, setting up routing, and handling edge cases. A significant portion of time was also spent troubleshooting issues related to state management and layout.

Feedback on This Challenge: I really enjoyed implementing the game logic and figuring out how to make the game interact smoothly with the user interface. However, the time spent troubleshooting deployment issues and managing dependencies (particularly with node.js versions and build issues) was less enjoyable. I have no clue how to set up the render. There is limited available resources and I don't have time to figure out while I am already almost done with all other things.
